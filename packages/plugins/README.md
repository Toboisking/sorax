# Official plugins

Each directory is a separately installable SORAX plugin. Plugins are currently installed from Git URLs, not npm. The URL can omit a branch name to use the repository's default branch.

These packages are not bundled with SORAX or loaded automatically. Do not add them to Core's dependencies, its built-in plugin registry, or the repository's `.sorax/plugins/` directory.
